# Road-Crack-Detection
This is one of the models in my graduation project to detect road cracks to ensure safety on the roads and prevent accidents. The idea of the project was a smart city management system where surveillance cameras were attached to light poles to automatically detect many things by computer vision and then perform an action as a response. So one of those things was road cracks. If a road crack is detected, the location of the crack will be sent to the central management system in order to be repaired.
